The decision-making processes of households are influenced by a variety of factors, as illustrated through arrows surrounding the adoption decision of Household A.
The households in the model are interconnected through a social network, with social influences originating from interactions within this network.
The model is not intended to provide precise predictions of energy efficiency diffusion; 
rather, its purpose is to yield insights regarding the effectiveness of various interventions in fostering energy efficiency diffusion.
The model simulates individual adoption and community adoption, as shown in the following figures.
