# EE_adoption_ABM
This model aims to simulate and examine the effects of interventions on the adoption and diffusion of energy efficiency. 
The real-world system that this model seeks to emulate is depicted in the following figure.

The decision-making processes of households are influenced by a variety of factors, as illustrated through arrows surrounding the adoption decision of Household A.
The households in the model are interconnected through a social network, with social influences originating from interactions within this network.
The model is not intended to provide precise predictions of energy efficiency diffusion; 
rather, its purpose is to yield insights regarding the effectiveness of various interventions in fostering energy efficiency diffusion.
The model simulates individual adoption and community adoption, as shown in the following figures.
