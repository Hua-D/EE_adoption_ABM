# EE_adoption_ABM
This model aims to simulate the energy efficiency examine the effects of interventions on the adoption and diffusion of energy efficiency. 
The real-world system that this model seeks to emulate is depicted in the following figure.

The decision-making processes of households are influenced by a variety of factors, as illustrated through arrows surrounding the adoption decision of Household A.
The households in the model are interconnected through a social network, with social influences originating from interactions within this network.
The model is not intended to provide precise predictions of energy efficiency diffusion; 
rather, its purpose is to yield insights regarding the effectiveness of various interventions in fostering energy efficiency diffusion.
